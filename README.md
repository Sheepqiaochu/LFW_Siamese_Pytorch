# LFW_Siamese_Pytorch
This project uses the ​Labeled Faces in the Wild​ (LFW) dataset​, and the goal is to train variants of deep architectures to learn when a pair of images of faces is the same ​person​ or not. It is a pytorch implementation of Siamese network with 19 layers.

Details of this project has been post to my website: https://tianyusong.com/2017/11/16/pytorch-implementation%E2%80%8B-siamese-network/
